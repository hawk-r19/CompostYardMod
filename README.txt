### Thanks for downloading my mod!
## Original mod by CeeBYL, Compost Yard Overhaul https://www.nexusmods.com/farthestfrontier/mods/18?tab=description
### Features:
Increases Compost Yard's max worker limit up to 8, which can be configured. By default, it increases it to 2.
Currently working for game version 0.9.0.
### Installation:
Make sure MelonModÂ v0.6.1 is installed (I haven't tested with other versions, so I don't know if they will work).
Copy the CompostYardWorkers.dll file into .../FarthestFrontier/Mods.
### Configuration:
Run the game with the mod installed at least once.
Open the file .../FarthestFrontier/UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg.
Under [Compost_Yard_Workers], change "YardMaxWorkers" to anything between 1 to 8.
### Notes:
I'm brand new to making mods, so please let me know what problems you have or any other mods/improvements y'all might want me to make. Thanks!
